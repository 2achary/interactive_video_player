        Now that we've looked at the architecture
        of the internet, let's see how you might

      <span id='2'>
        connect your personal devices to
        the internet inside your house.
      </span>

        Well there are many ways to

        cable Internet, or a phone line if you
        have DSL, running to the outside of

        the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.
